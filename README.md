A console-based Ticket Booking System developed using Java and Gradle that simulates the core functionalities of a real-world railway ticket booking platform. The application allows users to search for routes, check seat availability, and book or cancel tickets. It showcases core object-oriented programming principles like inheritance, encapsulation, and modular design. This project can be extended into a full-stack web or mobile solution in future iterations.
